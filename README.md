# Listing Number Test

IELTS listening test will examine your ability to catch a string of numbers, such as ID card Number, phone number, airport number and so on. Most of the time you have only one changce to listen the string.

In order to practice my ability to capture numbers in the listening exam, my friend and I wrote this not book on Colab to generate audios with random number strings and to play them automatically(Colab do not have audio-play device, so we can only use `IPython.display` instead of `pygame` to display the audio, which means you have to click it at the result below.)

You will see audio play bottoms under the fourth notbook boxes. The frist one is the whole test, and the following are exercises consisting the whole test.

You can change `id` to generate different tests, which will be stored locally (in terms of Colab).

You can play the fifth boxes to check the answer.

I do not plan to take the exam on computer, so this is the best way for me to check my answer on the paper. If you take the exam on computer, your answer have to be typed by keyboard. You can write a checking function to check the answers automatically.
